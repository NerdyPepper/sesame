\section*{Introduction}

Grover's algorithm is a quantum algorithm that finds, with high probability, 
the input to an unknown function, given the output value. It finds this value 
in $ O(\sqrt{N}) $ evaluations of the function over the database.

If was invented by Lov Grover in the year 1996. It was proved in 1997, 
by Bennet Bernstein, that any quantum search algorithm has to perform atleast 
$ O(\sqrt{N}) $ of the function, hence, Grover's algorithm is almost optimal.

Like most quantum algorithms, Grover's algorithm is probablistic in nature. 
That is, the probability of the algorithm producing the correct answer is less than 1.
It \textit{is} possible to produce the correct answer all the time, but at the cost 
of runtime (repeating the number of iterations improves the probability).
