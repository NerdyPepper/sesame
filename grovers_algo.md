### Introduction

 - quantum algorithm
 - created by Lov Grover
 - used as a quantum search algorithm
 - probablistic / non-deterministic

### Quantum Gates used in Grover's search

 - intro to q-gates
 - Hadamard Gate - superposition (ket notation)
 - Pauli-X Gate - bitflip
 - Controlled NOT (CNOT) - one input affects other

### Unstructured Search

 - Problem definition
 - Mathematical definition
 - Formulae

### Grover's Method (Amplitude Amplification)

 - breif procedure 
 - ball bag analog
 - state setup
 - oracle function
 - grovers operator (mathematical formula, ket notation)
 - graphs, time complexity

### Time complexity of Grover's Search
 
 - types of Quantum Problem (BQP, DQP)
 - comparision with classical search algorithm
 - O(N) vs O(sqrt(N))
 - Hidden variable theory
 - O(cbrt(N)) time complexity improvement

### Applications and Limitations

 - expression of database as quantum superposition
